NOTES:
-add an actual day counter to the root section so its a little bit easier to see how much you have to spend in x days
-Wow, Gdocs has an extensive API for accessing spreadsheets. Consider importing to that, or possibly using that?

BUGS:

 
TODO:
-use CHCSVParser to parse the CSV, consider writing something serverside to convert the spreadsheets
