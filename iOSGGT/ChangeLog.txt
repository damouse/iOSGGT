Changelog for iOSGGT


    Current TODO List
Bugs
-Main graph did not refresh correctly upon directory add
-Dates are messed up for the current date on the grant controller
-Parsing is incorrect; using the testing directory changes the data for the other grants
    -Grant detail page does not display a whole pie chart, likely corrupted/misparsed data (use open and paid instead of budget)
-"Participant" grant lists Suman Banjeree in the wrong place, should this be dynamically checked for or fixed? (argue for fix)
-Agency Award Number is not present in "Participant" grant, create "not entered" fall-through
    -Fix doesn't work....
-Fix "last updated" parse bug on GraphView controller
-Got a "Please enter valid URL" message after creating, successfully adding a directory, deleting, and then trying to create another new directory
-End date parsing is incorrect (as displayed in the root view)
-Inside date parsing is wrong. Account entries have off dates


New Features
-Manual refresh button on root view
-Popup on point click on the landscape view
-Segue to account details on legend (table) click 


Other
-Clear "[fill url here]" text when the textview becomes first responder
-Problem: grant information is inconsistent; in "Participant Support" the account budgeting does not sum to the overall budget; accounts have negative values throwing off the pie chart
    -Consider making a "peek" mode to display the the raw data in case of any odd display artifacts
-Make the lines between account entries more distinct
-Change the directory url requirements; remove the need for "http://" and GGT_Handler.php
-Change some of the darker colors (blue, brown, etc). Just make them brighter. 
-Make Fiscal Year headers for Account Entries


1.1 Changes 6/2/13

-Main grant detail page now segues to the correct Account Details view
