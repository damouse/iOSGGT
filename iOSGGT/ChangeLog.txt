Other
-Clear "[fill url here]" text when the textview becomes first responder

    -Consider making a "peek" mode to display the the raw data in case of any odd display artifacts
-Make the lines between account entries more distinct
-Change the directory url requirements; remove the need for "http://" and GGT_Handler.php
-Change some of the darker colors (blue, brown, etc). Just make them brighter. 
-Make Fiscal Year headers for Account Entries
